# Ensure Affordable and Clean energy for healthcare

**Objective**: Ensuring economically and environmentally viable energy for healthcare sectors. 

**Suggestion**: Predictive Solar Power Usage in Hospitals.

Proposition is to make use of _Physics Informed Neural Network_ in predicting solar power of any target region for a specific step-ahead window, and use that information to have _prior knowledge_ about the _potential of solar energy_ for the _window_. This would enable the healthcare sectors to have a safer, and cheap power. Obviously, the demand for fossil-fuel based energy can’t be disregarded completely, but can be minimized by a larger factor. 

_“Make fossil-fuel based energy a backup, not a necessity”_

**Technology Stack**: 
Artificial Intelligence, and 
Chaos Theory
